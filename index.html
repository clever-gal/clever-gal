                  <h2>I am, first and foremost, a <span>storyteller.</span></h2>
                      <p>At the tender age of 12, I penned my first memoir. Oddly enough, nobody clambored for an illustrated account detailing the internal woes of an aspiring limo driver/ bestselling author coming of age in North Texas suburbia. At 12, I didn't yet have much to write about, but that sure as sh*t didn't stop me from telling a story. Stories are important. They help us make sense of the world - who we are, where we come from, and where we're going. Stories unite or divide us. They inspire feeling and emotion, empowering us to shift our thinking, make big changes, and connect more deeply to each other. Sticks and stones may break your bones, but stories spark revolutions.</p>
                      <p>And that is why I write copy - because, at it's heart, copywriting is telling a story, and crafting a message about a product, person, or service that empowers, engages, and inspires change. Any writer can splash words onto a page, organizing paragraphs and sentences with surgical precision in an effort to present readers with cold information. But I'm a storyteller - a firestarter - using words to spark a sizzling passion, powerfully harnessing words in a way that connects, motivates, and ignites. And I'm skilled at marrying top-notch copy with stellar SEO, so that YOUR story, your visionary product, service, or business, isn't just "out there" floating aimlessly on the web - it's found by the folks you're passionate to reach.
                      <p>If you still aren't certain that I'm your gal, read further and discover exactly why I'm the sea salt to your caramel.

                    <h3>I'm Well-Rounded</h3>
                    <p>I completed my economics undergrad degree in four years from a top-100 college on the beach, which means that I know how to stay laser-focused with huge distractions afoot (like mongo waves, man).</p>
                    <p>I've also travelled extensively, seen things, gained some perspective, and experienced some (but definitely not all) of life's emotional depth, making me an even better communicator and (more importantly) writer. For over two years, I ran a popular "mommy blog," achieving publication in various online and print platforms. I'm also comfortable writing and editing foundational tech language like HTML, CSS, and Javascript (in fact, I built this website from scratch), and navigating online writing platforms like Wordpress, Squarespace, and Medium (to name a few).</p>

                    <h3>I Play Well with Others</h3>
                    <p>After completing my undergrad degree, I went on to earn a fancy graduate degree in Conflict and Dispute Resolution. Essentially, I spent two years after college practicing better communication, healthy conflict management practices, and how to not be an asshole.</p>
                    <p>Most folks aren't so hot at working through problems and disagreements proactively, especially in a working relationship. My promise is to always communicate respectfully with you, and address any issues directly, so that we can stay in sync, and on track for creating beautiful work together. I'm also a helluvalot of fun to work with, and a real "team player," bringing a healthy dose of focus, fun, and feeling to the table.</p>

                    <h3>I Give a Million F*cks</h3>
                    <p>You know when you work with someone who, quite frankly, gives zero f*cks? Isn't it just the WORST? When you work with someone who doesn't share your degree of passion and enthusiasm, it brings down the quality of the whole project, and fizzles your sizzle. I only take on a handful of clients who do work that inpires ME, ensuring that I'll stay fired up about working for YOU.</p>
                    <p>Plus, you get much more of my focus, time, and energy, resulting in a finished piece, delivered on time, that I (and, more importantly, YOU) feel amazing about. See, I don't just work for paychecks - I partner with people who are following their purpose and passion, and are hell bent on doing meaningful work in the world. Can't you just feel the electricity?</p>
