                  <h2>You are extraordinary</h2>
                      <p>You live each day with passion, and you aim to leave the world better than you found it. You create with purpose - to build community, catalyze change, share beauty, and forge a brighter future.</p>
                      <h3>You have big dreams.</h3>
                      <p>Those dreams became ideas, and with your blood, sweat, and tears, those ideas became reality, taking the form of a product or service that is sure to delight, engage, and transform your customers.</p>
                      <p>My gift is finding and capturing your unique audience, crafting a message that speaks to them and reaches them exactly where they are.</p>
                      <p>I develop contagious content for courageous visionaries.</p>
                      <h3>I'm here to help you make your mark.</h3>

                   <h3>Results</h3>
                   <p>You've invested blood, sweat, and tears into creating a world-changing product or service, and now it's time for the masses to come running... but nobody knows about you (yet)! My job is to find your tribe and speak their language. I'm here to not only craft a meaningful message, but also to utilize the latest in Search Engine Optimization and other online wizardry to get it in front of the folks who need to hear it.</p>

                    <h3>Passion</h3>
                    <p>Authentic passion inspires great copy. I am painfully, can't-eat-can't-sleep passionate about writing, but not just for its own sake. What truly fuels me is sharing the glory of your remarkable business with customers and clients waiting for a product or service exactly like yours. You're laboring to make a meaningful mark on the world, and I do what I do because I'm fired up to be a part of it.</p>

                    <h3>Expertise</h3>
                    <p>I have spent the majority of my life studying how to use words more purposefully. My copywriting experience is vast - blog posts, press releases, business plans, you name it - but always centers on some aspect of storytelling and selling ("story-selling," if you will). Nothing moves an audience like a good story, and when you infuse that story with strategic technology and targeted language, well... KABOOM!</p>
