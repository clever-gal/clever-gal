                  <h2>Every<span>exceptional </span>product, blog, and business tells a<span>story.</span></h2>
                      <p>Stories are important. They help us make sense of the world - who we are, where we come from, and where we're going. Stories unite or divide us; they inspire feeling and emotion, empower us to shift our thinking, to make big changes, and to connect more deeply to each other.
                      <h3>Sticks and stones may break your bones, but stories spark revolutions.</h3>
                      <p>And that is why I write copy - because, at it's heart, copywriting is telling a compelling story, and crafting a message about a product, person, or service that captivates a specific audience. I write authentic, relatable content tailormade for YOU. I'm a storyteller - a firestarter - using language to spark sizzling passion, powerfully harnessing words in a way that connects, motivates, and ignites.</p>
                      <h3>My gift is creating stories that move people, evoke emotion, and stimulate connection.</h3>
                      <h3>So tell me: what story do you want to share with the world?</h3>

                    <h3>Dedication</h3>
                    <p>YOU are my priority. My goal is to deliver the highest quality content on time. I'm here to create content that fits your specific needs, and matches your unique tone. I'm here to tell your story to an audience waiting to hear it, and my job is to get it right.</p>

                    <h3>Passion</h3>
                    <p>Great projects are fueled by authentic passion - without it, copy falls flat, and messaging misses its mark. My passion is sharing your brand or service with your audience, reaching your tribe with an authentic message about the good you're doing in the world.</p>
               </div>

                    <h3>Story</h3>
                    <p>Every successful brand, product, and business tells a story. Stories help us make sense of the world, and a compelling story stirs emotion, connection, and ultimately, action. Your business has a story to tell, and I want to be the gal who tells it.</p>
