                  <h2>I am, first and foremost, a <span>storyteller.</span></h2>
                      <p>At the tender age of 12, I penned my first memoir. Oddly enough, nobody clambored for an illustrated account detailing the internal woes of an aspiring limo driver/ bestselling author coming of age in North Texas suburbia. At 12, I didn't yet have much to write about, but that sure as sh*t didn't stop me from telling a story.</p>
                      <p>Stories are important. They help us make sense of the world - who we are, where we come from, and where we're going. Stories unite or divide us. They inspire feeling and emotion, empowering us to shift our thinking, make big changes, and connect more deeply to each other. Sticks and stones may break your bones, but stories spark revolutions.</p>
                      <p>And that is why I write copy - because, at it's heart, copywriting is about telling a story, and crafting a message about a product, person, or service that empowers, engages, and inspires change. Any writer can splash words onto a page, organizing paragraphs and sentences with surgical precision in an effort to present readers with cold information. But I'm a storyteller - a firestarter - using words to spark a sizzling passion, powerfully harnessing words in a way that connects, motivates, and ignites.
                      <p>If you still aren't certain that I'm your gal, read further and discover exactly why I'm the sea salt to your caramel.

                    <h3>My Flashy Flair</h3>
                    <p>Let me just toot my own horn here for a sec: I graduated in exactly four years from a top-100 college on the beach. This means that I know how to keep my head down and focus when there are huge distractions afoot (like mongo waves, man). I earned my degree in economics and business, which means I'm qualified to use lots of important words, like "gross domestic product," "overhead cost," and "comparative advantage."</p>
                    <p>I also travelled extensively, to places like South Africa, Ireland, Scotland, Italy, France, and Spain, and maintained my fair share of dating relationships. This means that I've seen things, gained some perspective, and experienced some (but definitely not all) of life's emotional depth, making me an even better communicator and (more importantly) writer. And let's not forget, I'm also quite comfortable interacting with foundational tech language - like HTML, CSS, and Javascript - and navigating online writing platforms like Wordpress, Squarespace, and Medium (to name a few).</p>

                    <h3>I Play Well with Others</h3>
                    <p>Shortly after completing my undergrad economics degree, I decided that I'd studied entirely the wrong thing. So, as one does, I shelled out a lot of dough for a do-over, and earned a fancy graduate degree in Conflict and Dispute Resolution. Essentially, I spent two years after college practicing better communication, healthy conflict management practices, and how to not be an asshole.</p>
                    <p>I discovered that most folks aren't so hot at talking through problems and disagreements, especially in a working relationship. My promise to you is that I will always communicate respectfully, and address problems or differences of opinion directly, so that we can stay in sync, and on track for creating beautiful work together. I'm also a helluvalot of fun to work with, and a real "team player," bringing a healthy dose of focus, fun, and feeling to the table.</p>

                    <h3>I Give a Million F*cks</h3>
                    <p>You know when you work with someone who, quite frankly, gives zero f*cks? It is the WORST. When you work with someone who doesn't share your degree of passion and enthusiasm, it brings down the quality of the whole project, and fizzles your sizzle. I only take on a handful of clients who do work that inpires ME, ensuring that I'll stay fired up about working for YOU. I don't just work for paychecks, I work for people with purpose and passion who are hell bent on doing meaningful work in the world.</p>
